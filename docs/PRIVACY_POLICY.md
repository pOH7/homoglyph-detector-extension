# Privacy Policy for Homoglyph Detector

**Last Updated:** 13/08/25

## Overview

Homoglyph Detector is a Chrome extension designed to protect users from phishing attacks by detecting Unicode lookalike characters (homoglyphs) on web pages. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What the Extension Accesses:
- **Web page content**: The extension scans text content on web pages you visit to detect homoglyphs
- **Extension preferences**: Your enable/disable settings are stored locally in your browser

### What We Do NOT Do:
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not track your browsing history
- We do not send any data to external servers
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not store or transmit web page content

## Data Processing

All homoglyph detection is performed entirely within your browser:
- Text analysis happens locally on your device
- No web page content leaves your browser
- Detection results are only displayed to you
- No data is shared with third parties

## Data Storage

The extension stores minimal data locally:
- **Browser Storage**: Your preference settings (enable/disable state) are stored using Chrome's sync storage
- **No External Storage**: No data is stored on external servers or databases

## Permissions

The extension requests these permissions:
- **activeTab**: To scan the current web page for homoglyphs
- **storage**: To save your preference settings

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Security

Since no data is transmitted or stored externally, your privacy is protected by design:
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- Your browsing data never leaves your device
- No network connections are made by the extension
